# SnmpAgent
Monitoring of Devices using SNMP

We start building one of the first multiplatform apps usingXamarin and #SNMP library, to allow devices configuration management and health monitoring in real time using Simple Networking Management Protocol (SNMP). Using this we will able to monitor various aspects of the device health like: uptime, memory usage, ping latency and number of processes and watch real time updates using popular Network Management Systems  (NMS) like Cacti and Nagios. We have also implemented SNMPv3 which incorporates authentication and encryption.
